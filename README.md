In this project, I have analyzed [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data).

## Data used for analysis is from 2018 January to 2019 August.

## Tasks Done

[Jupyter Notebook](Scripts/data_cleaning.ipynb) was used to clean the data.

[Tableau workbook](Scripts/Tableau_Challenge.twbx) can be found here.

### Below are the details of the Tableau Workbook.

#### Dashboard to analyze details of specific bike

#### Dashboard to get some overview  of other important City bike user/bike statistics.

#### A story with Dashboards and sheets.

### Worksheets to answer following questions are created.

* How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?

* By what percentage has total ridership grown?

* How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)

* Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?

* How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?

* How does the average trip duration change by age?

* What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?

* Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan?

* How variable is the utilization by bike ID?

Conclusion:

1) Popular stations have proximity to public transport systems like metro or rail.

2) Women riders are much lower than Men riders.

3) There's a growth seen in ridership from 2018 to 2019.

4) More ridersship observed during summer than winter.
